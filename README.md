# Face-Recogniton
It is an OpenCV project which can correctly identify the name of the person in Video stream or tell that to which person does that live stream face resembles the most, after retrieving it from stored images.
First install cv2 library on your device using 
        pip install cv2 
Then download the haarcascade classifier for frontal face
Create a directory named 'data', where you could store the images in form of array.(By running face_data_collection.py file)
And then run the face_recognition.py file which predicts the face in the live video capture by using KNN algorithm.
